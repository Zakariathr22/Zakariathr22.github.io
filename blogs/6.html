        <h3>Why Microsoft Was Right to Cut Off IMOD</h3>
        <p>
            As a software engineer, I often think about the power of the tools we build. Technology is never
            neutral, it can be used to solve problems, but it can also be misused in ways that harm people. That’s
            why I believe Microsoft’s recent decision to cease and disable specific Azure and AI services for
            Israel’s Ministry of Defense was not only right, but necessary.
        </p>

        <h2>Technology Should Not Enable Mass Surveillance of Civilians</h2>
        <p>
            One of the core principles of modern computing is trust. Users (whether individuals, companies, or
            governments) rely on platforms like Azure to handle sensitive data responsibly. If a company’s technology is
            used for indiscriminate surveillance of civilians, that trust is broken.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cloud services are not tools for mass surveillance. This aligns with a broader principle that should guide
            all of us in tech.
        </p>

        <h2>Setting Boundaries Matters</h2>
        <p>
            It’s easy for a big company to look away when powerful customers misuse their products. But real leadership
            shows up when a company draws a line, even if it means losing a client or facing political backlash.
        </p>
        <p>
            Microsoft’s choice here shows that principles matter more than profits. For engineers like me, that’s
            reassuring. It signals that the effort we put into building systems isn’t wasted on purposes that betray
            human values.
        </p>

        <h2>A Step Toward Ethical Responsibility in AI</h2>
        <p>
            We talk a lot about ethics in AI, but it’s often just talk. This is an example of action. AI can be
            transformative (helping doctors predict diseases, reducing energy waste, improving accessibility) but in the
            wrong hands, it can also fuel oppression.
        </p>
        <p>
            By refusing to let its AI infrastructure be used for large-scale surveillance of civilians, Microsoft
            reminded the industry that <q>ethics isn’t an add-on, it’s a baseline</q>.
        </p>


        <h2>Why This Decision Matters Beyond Microsoft</h2>
        <p>
            I don’t think this decision is just about one company or one government contract. It’s about setting a
            precedent. If the largest players in tech show that they are willing to shut down unethical uses of their
            platforms, it pressures the rest of the industry to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
            For me, this sparks a bit of hope. Hope that engineers won’t always be trapped in the dilemma of
            <strong>build cool
                things but watch them be misused.</strong> Hope that the industry can mature into something where
            ethical guardrails
            are the norm, not the exception.
        </p>

        <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            As engineers, we don’t control every outcome of our work. But we do have a voice in the kind of industry we
            want to be part of. Supporting decisions like this is one way to push for a world where technology empowers
            people instead of watching over them.
        </p>
        <q>
            Pulling IMOD off Azure doesn’t undo the surveillance, it just means their war crimes lost cloud backup.
        </q>
        <p>
            Microsoft’s move isn’t perfect and it won’t solve every ethical dilemma in tech, but it’s a step in the right
            direction. And as someone who builds software, I’d rather see steps like this than silence.
        </p>
